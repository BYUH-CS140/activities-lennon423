        <p><strong>Weddings</strong> are once-in-a-lifetime moments, and we are honored to capture every tear, laugh, and joyful kiss. Our team ensures that your special day is preserved in high-resolution beauty, from the ceremony to the final dance.</p>

        <p>Graduation is not just a ceremony—it's a symbol of achievement. We provide both candid and staged shots that highlight your academic success and personality. Don't forget to wear your cap and gown, and maybe toss it in the air for a perfect <abbr title="High Definition">HD</abbr> slow-motion capture!</p>
        <p id="christening"><strong>Christenings</strong> and religious events carry deep emotional meaning. With great respect and attention to detail, we document these moments so families can look back and reflect on this spiritual journey with love and pride.</p>

We handle both <strong>photography</strong> and <em>videography</em> using state-of-the-art equipment, including 4K drones and mirrorless cameras.</p>
        <p>As professionals, we believe in creating not just content but <cite>timeless stories</cite>. From color grading to sound design, our post-production ensures that each clip is as polished as a movie. Ask about our special editing services for social media reels and YouTube intros!</p>
